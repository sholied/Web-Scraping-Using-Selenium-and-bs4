# Web-Scraping-Using-Selenium-and-bs4
I tried to make a script for web scraping to very hard website, that is https://www.bike24.com/
element that I scraping is e-bike catgory with three element: Product Name, Manufacturer and Item code.
First, I Select all links for e-bikes from page to page= and save the file name links.txt
Second, I do find element for one link to get the three element and save for every links with name e-bike2.csv

The Libraries that I used are Selenium and bs4.
